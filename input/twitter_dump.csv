"@MrNishKumar Despite being a massive Acaster fan, I will only buy this book if James eats a cheese board"
@_AlexYates_ Mine gets £5 every time that happens. He still has no money.
@MongoDB When all other options had been exhausted.
"@editor_Maguire It might be good to focus on some old technologies that business owners need to understand, too. In my experience, the focus on the new &amp;shiny without an understanding of the robust and old has led many business owners to some very expensive problems!"
"Watching @watsoncomedian in what seems to be a press conference, where all the interrogators are under 10 years old. Comedy gold."
@TheDataShed The sack race was certainly a sight to behold! Great day… #Lifestooshortforashitjob
@Amez_W How much did you buy?
@AlexCraven @DataShedAnna I used to sell off-cut notepads (nabbed from my dad’s printing factory!) and sold them for 20p a go. Made a small fortune at the time (I was 8)
@PsypherPunk My mother has always secretly hated me too.
@SkewSmug @MrNishKumar Nah. Always go for cunderthunt. It makes people think. And watching a cunderthunt suddenly realise what you’ve said is priceless.
"@Amez_W @RishiSunak I’ll get right on that. Although... if you’re expecting the budget and plans to be finalised more than 5 minutes before the announcement, then you might be disappointed..."

"@DataShedAnna @JediWinter I understand your point, but it feels as though we’re preparing for the Second Coming, not for someone to clean. Surely preparing for a task (intended to make our lives easier) shouldn’t make our lives infinitely harder?!"
@TomKerkhove Let’s wait and see what MS do with the worlds largest training data set. My money is on them using it to train algorithms to build applications...
@JediWinter @DataShedAnna @The_IoD Ps. They’ll never take our freedom.
@JediWinter @DataShedAnna @The_IoD Who are these “they”? Do we need to set some precautionary measures against entrepreneur-targeting “Ocean 11” types?!
@YAhkter @KaneFulton @DataShedAnna I think people can probably hear you from the other side of Leeds.
@georgiahalston @HalstonMarketin @jessfarrow_HM Did you mean delta? Or Data?

@FoohonPie Nice work!
@TurnerandGeorge Morning @TurnerandGeorge ! I’m still waiting on a delivery due on Tuesday - do you know where it is?!

"@DataShedAnna @Xero Wow. If our turn around was so slow with our clients, we’d be out of business by now...!"
"@DataShedStew @TheDataShed Knock em dead! (Figuratively, obvs)"
@virginmedia @_Freakyclown_ I’m sure ^JGS is receiving some quite aggressive feedback. The positive news is that they had the opportunity for their work to go viral before losing their job...
@StewartNorriss Looking fleek. Or some other word I don’t fully comprehend.
Just watching some covers of .@linkinpark Anyone else missing Chester right now?
@Amez_W @DataShedAnna @TheDataShed That sounds like a Morlock’s preferred brand of modelling clay.
@DataShedStew @DataShedAnna It's a testament to the engineering skills at @CERN that they were able to build a hard hat big enough to fit your head #BelieveIntheImpossible
@Amez_W Not yet!
"Nice rebrand, @zandramoore #pants #LeedsDigi19 https://t.co/9enhNfadaz"
@georgiahalston @StuartClarkeUK I can’t work out if that’s a positive thing. I’m just not down with the kids. Obviously.
